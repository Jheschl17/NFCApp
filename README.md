# NFCApp (name not yet final)
**NFCApp** is a android app to interface with NFC chips (device requires NFC chip).
With this app it will be possible to
+ read data off of NFC chips
+ emulate these NFC chips
+ export the NFC profiles
+ write the NFC profiles to new NFC chips
+ and much more

Users will furthermore be able to aquire NFC profiles from [nfc-bank](https://nfc-bank.com/bins.php?s=fa4818b0ec2622e224ee3071bf892fb2). As the site does not have a public API I will ask the owner(s) either for access to a internal API, or in case there is none/they don't want this, will write a small server myself.
